*   This is lab is about using the concept of inheritance and           *
*   polymorphism to create a hiearchy where a abstract class            *
*   (livingBeing) is being inherited by creature which gets inherited   *
*   predator and prey class. Where the user is asked to enter number of *
*   predators and preys so that it can be stored into a vector. Than    *
*   would use that user created data to stimulate them until the number *
*   of generations/preys/predators are not equal to 0.                  *
*                                                                       *
