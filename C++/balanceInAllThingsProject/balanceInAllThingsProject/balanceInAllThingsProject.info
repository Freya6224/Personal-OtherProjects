*   the input method weather from file or from keyboard. Then this      *
*   check's info whould be used to calculate the total amount of        *
*   checks, deposits, total balance, new balance (with only cashed      *
*   checks), and the difference between the new balance and total       *
*   balance. The info would be stored using the dynamic array as a      *
*   class object.                                                       *
