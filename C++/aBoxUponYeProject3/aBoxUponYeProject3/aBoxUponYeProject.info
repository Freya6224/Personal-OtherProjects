*   This project takes a phrase, frame character and justification      *
*   (left, right, center) from user. Then using the frame character     *
*   it would create a frame deepenind on the longest word in the        *
*   frame. Then the words would be placed with the frame depending      *
*   on the user choice for justification weather they want to place     *
*   phrase left/right/center of the frame. Then it would print the      *
*   final results. Added the extra option where user is given with the  *
*   modified frames from the programmer. If user chooces 1 of 4         *
*   frametypes than they won't be asked for frame character option.     *
*                                                                       *
