 /*
Finish by the mid-feb:

Currently I am trying to make my graphic game into more like a logic more than a hardcoding ---> so I made a virtual game which manipulates from the
graphical game. So right now I am working on checking the winner and letting the user know.

    * Steps:
    -check if the string is the same which cannot be implemented with the get method because it wont compare the value

    - Progress:
      -Created the win for the virtual game and which I think will work so

--> how to get the index of the value

Next Task by March:

1. Have to start different format player vs computer --> which involves all the components just like in player vs player
